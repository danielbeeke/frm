# Groups

sh:group defines a group for SHACL properties. In frm these groups are just an HTML div with some properties such as extra CSS classes and a optional title.

I am not sure if we can have nested groups at the moment.

At the moment there is another concept called __groupers__, sorry for the current naming.
